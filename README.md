##### Google Map Gps Cell Phone Tracker

Now available as a Wordpress plugin and Android client!

This project allows you to track cell phones periodically. For instance every minute or every five minutes. You can watch the cell phone being tracked in real time using Google Maps (and other map providers such as OpenStreetMaps) and you can store and reload routes easily. The map display page is built using bootstrap which makes the page responsive and also uses bootswatch which gives you the choice of 17 different themes. There are 4 clients, iOS, Android, Windows Phone and Java ME.

You have the following choices server side:

1.  ASP.NET with SQL Server
2.  PHP with your choice of:

- MySQL
- PostgreSQL
- SQLite

3.  Wordpress plugin with Android client

All 3 stacks are in the same download but you only need to use one.

By default the Tracker server is set up to use the included SQLite database. If you want to use one of the other supported database systems, edit the dbconnect.php file.
